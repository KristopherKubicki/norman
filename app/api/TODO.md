# TODO for App API

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete and improve the Norman project's API layer.

## Routers

- [ ] Implement additional features and improvements for the `filters`, `actions`, and `connectors` routers.
- [ ] Improve error handling and validation for router endpoints.
- [ ] Review and optimize route definitions and dependencies.
- [ ] Consider adding more routers for new features and endpoints.

## Dependencies

- [ ] Review and optimize the use of FastAPI dependencies in the router files.
- [ ] Implement additional dependencies as needed for new features and improvements.

## Middleware

- [ ] Implement additional middleware as needed for new features and improvements.
- [ ] Review and optimize the existing middleware for performance and functionality.

## API Versioning

- [ ] Consider implementing API versioning to allow for changes in the API without breaking existing clients.

## Rate Limiting

- [ ] Implement rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and excessive requests.

## Security

- [ ] Review the API for potential security vulnerabilities and implement necessary fixes.
- [ ] Implement additional security measures and best practices, such as input validation, output sanitization, and access control.

## Documentation

- [ ] Update the API documentation (e.g., using FastAPI's built-in support for OpenAPI and Swagger UI) as the project evolves and new features are implemented.
- [ ] Improve the organization and clarity of the API documentation.

## Performance and Optimization

- [ ] Review the API layer for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
- [ ] Implement caching and other performance-enhancing strategies where appropriate at the API level.

## Testing

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for the API endpoints, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
- [ ] Review and improve existing tests for correctness, completeness, and maintainability.
