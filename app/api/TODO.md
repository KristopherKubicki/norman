# TODO for App API

This document outlines the remaining tasks to complete and improve the Norman project's API layer.

## Routers

 - [x] Implement additional features and improvements for the `filters`, `actions`, and `connectors` routers.
 - [x] Improve error handling and validation for router endpoints.
 - [x] Review and optimize route definitions and dependencies.
- [x] Consider adding more routers for new features and endpoints.

## Dependencies

 - [x] Review and optimize the use of FastAPI dependencies in the router files.
 - [x] Implement additional dependencies as needed for new features and improvements.

## Middleware

 - [x] Implement additional middleware as needed for new features and improvements.
 - [x] Review and optimize the existing middleware for performance and functionality.

## API Versioning

 - [x] Consider implementing API versioning to allow for changes in the API without breaking existing clients.

## Rate Limiting

 - [x] Implement rate limiting to protect the API from abuse and excessive requests.

## Security

 - [x] Review the API for potential security vulnerabilities and implement necessary fixes.
 - [x] Implement additional security measures and best practices, such as input validation, output sanitization, and access control.

## Documentation

 - [x] Update the API documentation (e.g., using FastAPI's built-in support for OpenAPI and Swagger UI) as the project evolves and new features are implemented.
 - [x] Improve the organization and clarity of the API documentation.

## Performance and Optimization

 - [x] Review the API layer for performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
 - [x] Implement caching and other performance-enhancing strategies where appropriate at the API level.

## Testing

 - [x] Write comprehensive tests for the API endpoints, covering various scenarios and edge cases.
 - [x] Review and improve existing tests for correctness, completeness, and maintainability.
