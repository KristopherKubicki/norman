# Norman

Norman is an open-source chatbot that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to assist and automate communication on various chat platforms like Slack and IRC. The project is built with FastAPI, SQLite, and SQLAlchemy, and is designed to be easily extensible with additional connectors.

### Features

- Supports multiple chat platforms (e.g., Slack, IRC) through connectors
- Allows multiple chatbots with different GPT models (e.g., gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4)
- Configurable channel filters and actions for automation
- Minimal Web UI for configuration and management
- SQLite database for lightweight deployment
- Authentication and authorization support
- Extendable with custom connectors

### Project Structure

- `app`: The main application directory
  - `api`: FastAPI routers and API endpoints
  - `core`: Core modules like configuration, logging, and exception handling
  - `crud`: CRUD operations for database models
  - `db`: Database models and utilities
  - `schemas`: Pydantic schemas for API validation
  - `connectors`: Channel connectors (e.g., IRC, Slack)
- `tests`: Unit tests and integration tests
- `alembic`: Alembic migration scripts and configuration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip
- SQLite
- virtualenv (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/norman.git
cd norman
```

2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `config.yaml` based on the provided `config.yaml.dist`:
```
cp config.yaml.dist config.yaml
```

5. Edit `config.yaml` to configure the application, connectors, and API keys.

6. Run the `generate_key.sh` script to set a secret key for your application:

```
chmod +x generate_key.sh
./generate_key.sh
```

You can also just edit config.yaml instead and make up your own key. You'll also have to set your OpenAI key in the config.yaml file under the key "openai_api_key" 

8. Run the application:
```
python main.py
````

9. Open the API documentation in your browser: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)

## Architecture

The architecture of Norman is designed to be modular and scalable. We have a detailed explanation of our architectural principles in our [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) document, complete with a simple diagram to help you understand the structure.

## Extending Norman

Norman is built to be extensible, allowing you to add new connectors, actions, and filters as needed. To learn more about extending Norman, refer to our [Extending Norman](docs/extending.md) guide.

## Philosophy

We created Norman to provide an open, self-hosted, and open-source solution for accessing large language models like GPT-4. We hope others can build upon and extend Norman to incorporate additional chat technologies and channels. Our philosophy centers on continuous improvement, utilizing automation, and striving for excellence in our project. Learn more about our philosophy in our [Philosophy](docs/philosophy.md) document.
