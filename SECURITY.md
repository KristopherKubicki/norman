## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in the project, please follow these steps:

1. Do not open a public issue on GitHub.
2. Email us at norman.contact.email@gmail.com with the necessary details to reproduce the vulnerability.
3. We will review your report and assess the vulnerability. We may ask for additional information to better understand the issue.
4. We'll try to keep you informed about our progress towards resolving the issue.
5. Once the issue is resolved, we'll give you appropriate credit for discovering and reporting the vulnerability.

Please be patient, as security fixes may take some time depending on their complexity and the availability of the maintainers.

Thank you for helping us keep the project secure.
