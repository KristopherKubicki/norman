# Tox Connector

The Tox connector allows Norman to interact with the decentralized Tox messaging network. The current implementation is minimal and serves as a placeholder for future integration.

## Configuration

Add the following keys to your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
tox_tox_id: "your_tox_tox_id"
tox_friend_id: "your_tox_friend_id"
```

Replace the values with your own Tox ID and the friend ID you want Norman to message.
