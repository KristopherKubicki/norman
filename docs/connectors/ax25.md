# AX.25 Connector

The AX.25 connector allows Norman to interface with local packet radio
hardware.  It attempts to use the optional ``pyax25`` library when available
but can also fall back to a raw ``AF_AX25`` socket on Linux.

## Configuration

```yaml
ax25_port: "your_ax25_port"
ax25_callsign: "N0CALL"
```

## Usage

Instantiate ``AX25Connector`` with the desired port and callsign. Messages
queued via ``send_message`` will be transmitted when possible and also stored
locally for testing. Running ``listen_and_process`` will process incoming
frames and forward them to ``process_incoming``.

The connector functions even if the ``pyax25`` library is missing, but in that
case it only records sent messages without actually transmitting them.
