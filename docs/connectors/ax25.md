# AX.25 Connector

The AX.25 connector simulates interactions with packet radio hardware using UDP datagrams.

## Configuration

```yaml
ax25_port: "your_ax25_port"
ax25_callsign: "N0CALL"
```

## Usage

Messages are sent as UDP datagrams to ``localhost`` port ``8001``. Incoming datagrams
on that port are forwarded to Norman for processing.
