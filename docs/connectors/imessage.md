# Apple RCS/iMessage Connector

The iMessage connector allows Norman to communicate through Apple's RCS/iMessage service.

## Configuration

Add the following keys to your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
imessage_service_url: "your_imessage_service_url"
imessage_phone_number: "your_imessage_phone_number"
```

## Usage

Once these settings are in place, Norman can send and receive iMessage messages via the configured service. The implementation is a stub that can be expanded to integrate with your chosen gateway.
