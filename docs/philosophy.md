## Self-Hosted

We recognize that not everyone wants to rely on cloud-based services for their projects. By providing a self-hosted
solution, we aim to enhance privacy and autonomy for our users. Although Norman currently relies on an online connection
to interact with ChatGPT, our goal is to create a platform that respects user privacy and control.

## Open-Source Development

We believe in the power of open-source software and the value of collaboration. By making Norman open-source, we hope to
foster a community of developers who can contribute to the project, share ideas, and build upon our work to create
something even better.

## Continuous Improvement

We are committed to continuously improving Norman and incorporating feedback from our users. This includes regular
updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements that ensure Norman remains a cutting-edge platform for chatbot integration
and automation.

## Automation

We believe that automation can significantly improve efficiency and productivity. Norman is designed to facilitate the
automation of tasks and communication, making it easier for users to manage multiple chat platforms and channels while
reducing manual intervention.

## Community Engagement

Norman's development is driven by the needs and feedback of its users. We encourage our community to get involved,
report issues, suggest features, and contribute to the project in any way they can. Together, we can create a powerful
and versatile platform that benefits everyone.

## Future Goals

While Norman currently relies on an online connection to interact with ChatGPT, one of our long-term goals is to explore
ways to enable offline access to chat models. This may take time to achieve but represents our commitment to continually
evolving and improving the platform.
